# Malware-Classification

Dataset:
There are 2 datasets for this test. The first dataset contains labeled samples,
with 1000 samples from each of 5 malware families, for a total of 5000 labeled
samples. The families are denoted as “Family A” through “Family E.”

There is also a “challenge” dataset consisting of 500 unlabeled samples with
approximately 100 unlabelled samples from each of these same 5 malware families.
Each sample (in both datasets) consists of the first 4096 bytes of a malware executable, with each byte value given in decimal (within the range 0 to 255), with one
byte per line, in the form of a text file.

Part I:
sing your team’s specified ML technique, classify the labeled malware samples based on the provided feature vectors. Note that since the feature vectors
are 4096 bytes, they can be interpreted as 64×64 images. Experiment extensivelywith relevant hyperparameters to determine the highest accuracy that you can
obtain for the classification problem. Specify all hyperparmeters tested, clearly
state which hyperparameters yielded the best result, and give the accuracy for
your best case. For all experiments, use an 80-20 split for training and testing.
You do not need to perform cross-validation. You are allowed to experiment with
feature engineering, and you need to be careful not to overfit the training data.

Part II:
Experiment extensively with at least 2 additional ML techniques (or
major variations on a technique), which can include ensembles. Determine the
best accuracy that you can obtain on the labeled dataset. Clearly specify the
architectures and hyperparameters tested, and give your best accuracy. Note
that you are free to use any machine learning or deep learning techniques or
ensembles, and any feature engineering that might be useful

Part III:
Once you have determined your best technique from problem 1)
or 2), use it to classify the samples in the challenge dataset. Submit your classification results for the challenge dataset in a single text
